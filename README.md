# :wrench: dotfiles

This repo is a mash up inspired by serveral others zellwk/dotfiles, mathiasbynens/dotfiles, rkalis/dotfiles to name a few. The overall structure is from durdn/cfg.

These dotfiles don't require any symlinking or extra tooling. Your dotfiles live in your home directory, are version controlled, and easily modifiable. Happened to stumble upon this great idea - here is a write up about in Atlassion Â· https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles

| ðŸš§ Use at your own risk! |
| ----------------------- |

These dotfiles are my evergrowing, everchanging personal configurations which can break or change at any point.

```shell
bash <(curl -Lks https://example.com/Ge3Kn)
